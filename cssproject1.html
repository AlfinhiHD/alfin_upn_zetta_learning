    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
        The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby.
        The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). 
        Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of American technology and industry in the fight against communism. 
        Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War motifs to contemporary matters of the time.[1]
        Throughout most of the character's publication history, Iron Man has been a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers and has been featured in several incarnations of his own various comic book series. 
        Iron Man has been adapted for several animated television shows and films. 
        In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Tony Stark was portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the films Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), 
        Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019), while Mick Wingert voiced the character in the animated series What If...? (2021).
